Pytorch implementation of Relational Networks - [A simple neural network module for relational reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf)

Implemented & tested on Sort-of-CLEVR task.

## Sort-of-CLEVR

To replicate the results of the paper, we tuned the learning rate to 0.0002 (original implementation had 0.0001). We found this rate to produce the most accurate results, with ~92% accuracy for binary relational questions and ~99% for non-relational questions.
